# toniparicio.com port in python/django

This is a port from my portfolio https://toniparicio.com in python/django with educational purpose.

## API
Also is a sandbox for test some other python/django features. In this way also include a REST API with Oauth2 to my favorite book quotes, used in my site in footer.

## Postman
A postman collection is available for this API:
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e7eaa571c0b23def8b2f

Besides this API is well documented in  the /api route by a swagger.io documentation set.

## Database
The database is initial stored in a SQLite database, not available in this repository. My idea is test other databases as MySQL/MariaDB and MongoDB.
